Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived on a berry tree, on the banks of a river.
In the same forest lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile wanders deep into the river and comes to rest under the berry tree,
on which the monkey lived.

    The crocodile, having enjoyed the sweet berries that the monkey shared,
goes back to the tree the next day. The monkey happily shares the fruits from the tree.
They spend the entire day talking and eating berries. Soon,
the monkey and the crocodile became good friends and began to trust each other.
